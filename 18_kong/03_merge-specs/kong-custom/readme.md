## Extra: How to Register Custom Spec Plugin?

Community plugins like kong-spec-expose are not available in the Kong plugins section by default. To use it, we will build and use a custom Kong image.

1. See the kong-custom/Dockerfile. 
2. Now in docker-compose.yml Open and replace the kong images to use this custom kong image.

We are not building and using it at this time.
